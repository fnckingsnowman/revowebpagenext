This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

TO RUN SERVER ON LAN GO TO PACKAGE.JSON AND CHANGE THE SCRIPTS 'next dev' TO 'next dev -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3000' AND WITH THE IP ON THIS COMPUTER YOU ADD :3000 AT THE END OF IT AND STICK IT IN YOUR BROWSER.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
